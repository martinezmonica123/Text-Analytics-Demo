1    INT. DERELICT HOUSE – DAY <<COLOUR SEQUENCE>>                1 
     A POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH, clasped between finger and thumb: a 
     crude, crime scene flash picture of a MAN’S BODY lying on a 
     decaying wooden floor, a BLOODY MESS where his head should 
     be. 
     The image in the photo starts to FADE as we SUPER TITLES. The 
     hand holding the photo suddenly FANS it in a rapid FLAPPING 
     motion, then holds it still. The image fades more, and again 
     the picture is FANNED. 
     As TITLES END the image fades to nothing. The hand holding 
     the photo FLAPS it again, then places it at the front of a 
     POLAROID CAMERA. 
     The camera SUCKS the blank picture up, then the FLASH BURSTS. 
     The Polaroid camera is lowered, revealing the sweaty, heavy- 
     breathing face of LEONARD (mid-30’s). There are droplets of 
     blood across his face. Leonard stares, satisfied, at 
     something on the ground in front of him. There is WET BLOOD 
     on his BLUE SHIRT and BEIGE SUIT. His hand opens and catches 
     a HANDGUN which leaps up into his grasp. 
     Still staring, he crouches down and pulls a BODY off the 
     floor by the wet hair of its BLOODY HEAD. He slowly inserts 
     the barrel of the gun into the bloody mess where the mouth 
     should be. 
     Leonard FLINCHES. A DEAFENING ROAR as wet red leaps off his 
     face and suit and head, with a SPASM, reassembles itself 
     into the face of TEDDY (40’s, moustache) and we- 
                                                            CUT TO:

Close on Leonard’s eyes. He rolls them to one side, then 
     turns his head. 
                         LEONARD (V.O.) 
               So where are you? 
     Leonard lifts his head. He is lying on a queen-sized bed. 
                         LEONARD (cont’d) 
               You’re in some motel room.

3    EXT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY <<COLOUR SEQUENCE>>             3 
A late model Jaguar bumps across some railroad tracks and  
approaches a large, clearly abandoned DERELICT BUILDING.  
Leonard is driving. He wears a BEIGE SUIT and BLUE SHIRT (no  
blood). Next to him is TEDDY. Leonard stops the car next to a  
PICKUP TRUCK sitting Outside the derelict building. Leonard  
kills the engine, staring at the pickup. 
                         LEONARD 
               Looks like somebody’s home. 
     Teddy looks from Leonard to the pickup and back. 
                         TEDDY 
               That thing’s been here for years. 
     Leonard gets out of the Jaguar and moves to the pickup. He  
     inspects it with a methodical, practiced eye. Teddy follows. 
                         LEONARD 
               I think you’re wrong. These tracks aren’t             * 
               more than a few days old. 
     Leonard opens the door of the pickup and searches the  
     interior. On the dirty vinyl of the passenger seat he finds     *  
     six BULLETS. Leonard picks two of them up and studies them.     *  
     He drops them onto the dashboard then SHUTS the door.           * 
                         LEONARD (cont’d) 
               Let’s take a look inside. 
     Leonard walks towards the house, patting his jacket pockets.  
     Teddy leans on the pickup, uneasy, watching Leonard. 
4    INT. DERELICT BUILDING — DAY <<COLOUR SEQUENCE>>             4
     Leonard stands in the dimly-lit, decaying former hallway. He  
     pulls a stack of POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS out of his pocket and  
     leafs through them as Teddy starts walking towards him. 
     Leonard finds a photo showing Teddy with a shit-eating grin  
     standing in front of the pickup truck. On the broad white  
     strip beneath the photo is handwritten: 
     “TEDDY GAMMELL TEL. 555 0134” 
     Leonard flips the photo over. On the white strip on the back,  
     in the same small handwriting.

                         LEONARD (V.0.)                              * 
               I’ve finally found him. How long have I               * 
               been looking?                                         * 
     Leonard stuffs the Polaroids back into his pocket, reaches  
     around to the back of his waistband and draws a HANDGUN,  
     keeping it out of Teddy’s line of sight. Teddy enters, wary. 
                         TEDDY 
               Find anything? Didn’t think so, let’s go, 
               yeah? 
     Leonard neither replies nor turns around. Teddy, worried,  
     affects a casual air, shrugging dismissively, 
                         TEDDY (cont’d) 
               Fuck this. 
     Teddy turns and heads for the door. Leonard LEAPS on him, 
     pistol-whipping him furiously as he shouts: 
                         LEONARD 
               YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID! YOU BEG 
               FORGIVENESS, THEN YOU PAY! 
     Teddy is down. Leonard DRAGS him back, deeper into the dark    
     house. Leonard is in a frenzy. He dumps Teddy at the end of  
     the hall and stands over him. Teddy SPITS BLOOD. 
                         TEDDY 
               You don’t have a clue, you freak. 
     Leonard crouches down and grabs Teddy by the lapels. 
                         LEONARD 
               Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife’s  
               forgiveness before I blow your brains  
               out! 
                         TEDDY 
               Leonard, you don’t have a clue what’s 
               going on. You don’t
even know my name. 
                         LEONARD 
                    (triumphant smile)

     Leonard pulls down his trousers. On his right THIGH, crudely- 
     lettered: 
     “FACT 5. DRUG DEALER” 
     And immediately below this, in elegant, neat lettering: 
     “FACT 6. CAR LICENSE NUMBER: SG13 7IU”                          * 
     Leonard takes out the REGISTRATION DOCUMENT and examines it. 
     Holding the photo of Teddy and the registration document, 
     Leonard checks off his TATTOOED FACTS: 
                         LEONARD (cont’d) 
                   (under his breath) 
               White... male. First name... John. Last

                   (checks document against tattoo 
                    on thigh) 
               SG... 13... 7... IU. It’s him. It’s                   *  
               actually him. 
     Leonard looks coldly at Teddy’s smiling image. 
                         LEONARD (cont’d) 
               I found you, you fuck. 
     Leonard turns the photo face down, takes a pen and writes: 
     “HE IS THE ONE” 
     Leonard drops the pen. Thinks. He looks at his chest through 
     the mirror and a backwards tattoo suddenly BECOMES CLEAR: 
     “JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE” 
     Leonard buttons his blue shirt, then writes on the back of 
     Teddy’s picture: 
     “KILL HIM” 
     Leonard sticks the photo of Teddy BETWEEN HIS TEETH as he 
     holds his HANDGUN up and checks that it is loaded. He sticks 
     the GUN in the back of his waistband.

Leonard, in his boxers and plaid work shirt, shaving foam on

     RINGING PHONE.

                   (listens) 
     Leonard pulls his shirt off. There is a BANDAGE on his LEFT 
     ARM. He looks do at the TATTOOS ALL OVER HIS CHEST, STOMACH

     AND ARMS. 
                         LEONARD (cont’d) 
               So I can’t remember talking to you. What 
               did we talk about? 
                   (nods) 
               Sammy Jankis. Yeah, I guess I tell 
               people about Sammy to help them  
               understand. Sammy’s story helps me  
               understand my own situation. 
     Leonard touches the tattoo on the back of his hand. 
                         LEONARD (cont’d) 
               Sammy Jankis wrote himself endless  
               notes. But he’d get mixed up. I’ve got a  
               more graceful solution to the memory  
               problem. I’m disciplined and organized.  
               I use habit and routine to make my life  
               possible. Sammy had no drive. No reason  
               to make it work. 
     Leonard can see his reflection in the mirror. He studies the  
     tattoo across his chest: 
     “JOHN G. RAPED AND MURDERED MY WIFE”. 
                         LEONARD (cont’d) 
               Me? I gotta reason.

23   EXT. THE CITY GRILL ON MAIN ST. - DAY <<COLOUR SEQUENCE>>    23 
     Leonard parks the Jaguar, gets out, stops outside the door to  
     a restaurant, checking its name against a NOTE, written on a    *  
     SMALL PAPER BAG FROM A PHARMACY. The note says:                 * 
     “CITY GRILL, MAIN ST. THURSDAY, 1.OOPM MEET NATALIE FOR INFO” 
     He sticks the note in his pocket and pulls out his Polaroid 
     photographs. He flips through them until he finds Natalie’s. 
     Leonard flips the picture over. On the back are two  
     handwritten messages. The first one has been completely  
     scribbled over, the second reads: 
     “SHE HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE, SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY” 
24   INT. THE CITY GRILL ON MAIN STREET - DAY <<COLOUR SEQUENCE>> 24 
     Leonard enters, walking slowly down the aisle, looking at all  
     the customers. He makes eye contact with a WOMAN (brunette,  
     30’s) sitting alone, wearing SUNGLASSES. Her face betrays       *  
     nothing. Leonard walks past. She sighs and grabs the back of  
     his jacket as he passes. Leonard spins around. 
                         LEONARD 
               Natalie. 
     Leonard slips into the seat opposite her. Natalie is pretty,  
     but has bruising around one eye, and a mark on her lip. 
                         NATALIE 
               You don’t remember me.

               Must be tough living life according to a  
               few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry  
               list and your grocery list, you’ll be

               It is tough. Almost impossible. I’m sorry
